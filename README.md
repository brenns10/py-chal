Python Challenges
=================

These are my solutions to the
[Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com).  I'm writing code for all of
them, even if they don't necessarily need code.  Each challenge gets its own
file, and in the docstring I summarize the important details and solution.  When
you run the file, it should pop open the next challenge in your browser.
